- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BenjamenSimon
- ðŸ“– Iâ€™m interested in all things Statistics and Data Science. I've taken a focus on epidemics in my work because I enjoy them a lot, but I love sinking my teeth into any practical problem.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and Machine Learning and AI methods. I've mainly coded in Julia the past few years, with a background in R, so I'm ready to complete the triforce.
- ðŸ‘­ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on machine learning projects. I love to get my hands dirty with new tools, and I'm always curious about the next method that can be applied to epidemic data.
